# Netplan Role

Ansible role to install and configure Netplan.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

### Mandatory Variables to be Set that are Not Set with Defaults

#### Sample Network Configuration

Sample configuration to set up networking with Netplan:

```yaml
netplan_ethernets:
  - interface_name: 'eth0'
    dhcp4: 'no'
    gateway4: '10.1.0.1'
    addresses:
      - '10.1.0.10/24'
    nameservers:
      addresses:
        - '8.8.8.8'
        - '9.9.9.9'
      search:
        - 'domain.local'
        - 'domain.name'
```

### Variables that are Set with Defaults

#### Flag to delete any pre-existing Netplan configuration files

Flag decides on whether pre-existing Netplan configuration files should be deleted:

```yaml
netplan_remove_existing_configs: true
```

#### Name of the Netplan Configuration File Template

Name of the template providing the Netplan configuration file:

```yaml
netplan_configuration_file_template: 'config.yaml.j2'
```

#### Directory of the Netplan Configuration Files

Directory of the Netplan configuration files:

```yaml
netplan_configuration_dir: '/etc/netplan'
```

#### Name of the Netplan Configuration File

Name of the Netplan configuration file:

```yaml
netplan_configuration_file: 'config.yaml'
```

#### Path to the Netplan Configuration File

Path to the Netplan configuration file:

```yaml
netplan_configuration_file_path: "{{ (netplan_configuration_dir, netplan_configuration_file) | path_join }}"
```

#### Packages to be Installed

List of packages that need to be installed:

```yaml
netplan_packages:
  - 'netplan.io'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cleaning Up: Please Uninstall Package ifupdown Manually

Before the package `ifupdown` can be safely removed netplan networking 
needs to be properly configured.
If the package is removed too early, the role will hang.

For that reason this role does **not** handle the removal of the `ifupdown` package.

## Limitations

### Bootstrapping Network Configurations is not Supported

Please note that networking configurations can not be bootstrapped during
role execution.
The respective managed nodes need networking to be configured already.

### Changing IP Addresses are not Handled

Be aware that it is not permissible to change the IP addresses of a 
managed node during role execution. 
Otherwise, this might result in a hanging role as soon as `netplan apply`
is executed, because Ansible loses its SSH connection in that case.

## Dependencies

None.
